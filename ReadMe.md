Elevator Simulation Application 

OverView
This Elevator Simulation Application is a console-based program that simulates the behavior of an elevator system in a building. It includes functionality for requesting elevators, dispatching the nearest available elevator, handling passenger limits, 

The application is designed with a modular architecture, making it maintainable and extensible. It incorporates clean coding principles and unit tests to ensure reliability and scalability.

Features

Building Configuration:

Define the number of floors and elevators in the building.

Elevator Simulation:

Request elevators to a specific floor.

Dispatch the nearest available elevator.

Handle passenger limits with the option to remove passengers or request another elevator.

Passenger Management:

Add or remove passengers from an elevator.

Display appropriate error messages if passenger limits are exceeded.

Elevator State Management:

Track the current floor of each elevator.

Update the elevatorâ€™s state (Moving Up, Moving Down, Stationery).

Prevent elevators from moving if already at the requested floor.

Error Handling:

Gracefully handle invalid requests (e.g., floor out of range, no available elevators).

Test Coverage:

Comprehensive unit tests to validate core functionalities such as requesting the nearest elevator, passenger management, and error scenarios.

Prerequisites

Programming Language: C#

Framework: .NET Core

Dependencies:

Moq (for unit testing)

xUnit (for testing framework)
